**YouTube Data Harvesting and Warehousing using SQL and Streamlit**



**Introduction**

YouTube Data Harvesting and Warehousing is a project that aims to allow users to access and analyze data from multiple YouTube channels. The project utilizes SQL and Streamlit to create a user-friendly application that allows users to retrieve, store, and query YouTube channel and video data.

**Project Overview**

The YouTube Data Harvesting and Warehousing project consists of the following components:
- Streamlit Application: A user-friendly UI built using Streamlit library, allowing users to interact with the application and perform data retrieval and analysis tasks.
- YouTube API Integration: Integration with the YouTube API to fetch channel, video and comments data based on the provided channel ID.
- SQL Data Warehouse: Migration of data from the YouTube API to a SQL database, allowing for efficient querying and analysis using SQL queries.


**Technologies Used**

The following technologies are used in this project:
- Python: The programming language used for building the application and scripting tasks.
- Streamlit: A Python library used for creating interactive web applications and data visualizations.
- YouTube API: Google API is used to retrieve channel and video data from YouTube.
- SQL (MySQL): A relational database used as a data warehouse for storing migrated YouTube data.
- Pandas: A data manipulation library used for data processing and analysis.
